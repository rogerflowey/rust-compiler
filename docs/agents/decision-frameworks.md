# RCompiler Technical Decision Frameworks

This document provides structured approaches for making technical decisions specific to the RCompiler project implementation.

## Language Feature Implementation Decisions

### 1. New Language Feature Evaluation

When implementing new language features:

```markdown
Decision Criteria:
- Feature complexity and implementation effort
- Impact on existing language constructs
- Required changes to AST, HIR, and semantic passes
- Performance implications for compilation
- Compatibility with language specification

Implementation Approach:
1. Minimal Viable Implementation
   - Basic syntax and semantics
   - Essential type checking
   - Core code generation

2. Full Implementation
   - Complete feature support
   - Advanced type checking
   - Optimization support

3. Incremental Implementation
   - Phase 1: Basic parsing and AST
   - Phase 2: Semantic analysis
   - Phase 3: Code generation and optimization
```

### 2. AST Design Decisions

When designing AST node structures:

```markdown
Design Considerations:
- Memory efficiency vs. expressiveness
- Visitor pattern integration
- Serialization requirements
- Debugging and pretty-printing needs

Common Patterns:
- Use std::variant for sum types
- Implement CRTP visitor base classes
- Provide location information for all nodes
- Support move semantics for efficiency
```

### 3. Type System Extensions

When extending the type system:

```markdown
Evaluation Criteria:
- Type safety and correctness
- Performance of type operations
- Integration with existing type inference
- Memory usage considerations

Implementation Options:
1. Extend existing type hierarchy
2. Create new type categories
3. Use type parameterization
4. Implement type aliases
```

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Pass Architecture Changes

When modifying semantic analysis passes:

```markdown
Decision Factors:
- Pass dependency requirements
- Data flow between passes
- Incremental compilation support
- Parallel execution possibilities

Change Approaches:
- Add new pass (minimal disruption)
- Modify existing pass (tighter integration)
- Restructure pipeline (major architectural change)
```

### 2. Data Structure Choices

When selecting data structures for compiler components:

```markdown
Performance Considerations:
- Lookup frequency (hash tables vs. trees)
- Memory locality (arrays vs. linked structures)
- Modification patterns (immutable vs. mutable)
- Size requirements (compact vs. verbose representations)

Common Choices:
- Symbol tables: std::unordered_map
- AST nodes: std::variant with smart pointers
- Type information: interned strings with IDs
- Error reporting: vector of structured error objects
```

### 3. Memory Management Strategy

When deciding on memory management approaches:

```markdown
Project Standards:
- Use RAII consistently
- Prefer smart pointers for ownership
- Use raw pointers for non-owning references
- Implement custom allocators for performance-critical areas

Decision Framework:
1. Ownership semantics (unique vs. shared)
2. Lifetime requirements
3. Performance constraints
4. Exception safety requirements
```

## Performance Optimization Decisions

### 1. Compilation Speed Optimization

When optimizing compilation performance:

```markdown
Optimization Targets:
- Lexing and parsing speed
- Semantic analysis efficiency
- Code generation performance
- Memory usage during compilation

Approaches:
- Algorithmic improvements
- Data structure optimization
- Caching and memoization
- Parallel processing
```

### 2. Memory Usage Optimization

When optimizing memory consumption:

```markdown
Optimization Areas:
- AST memory footprint
- Symbol table size
- Type information storage
- Intermediate representations

Techniques:
- String interning
- Compact data representations
- Lazy evaluation
- Memory pooling
```

## Error Handling Decisions

### 1. Error Reporting Strategy

When designing error handling for new components:

```markdown
Project Standards:
- Use structured error types (utils/error.hpp)
- Include precise location information
- Support error accumulation
- Provide helpful error messages

Decision Factors:
- Error recovery requirements
- User experience considerations
- Debugging needs
- Performance impact
```

### 2. Error Recovery Approaches

When implementing error recovery:

```markdown
Recovery Strategies:
- Panic mode (skip to synchronization point)
- Phrase level (local repairs)
- Error productions (grammar extensions)
- Semantic repairs (type inference fixes)

Selection Criteria:
- Language complexity
- Error frequency
- Recovery quality needs
- Implementation complexity
```

## Testing Strategy Decisions

### 1. Test Coverage Planning

When determining testing approach:

```markdown
Coverage Requirements:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end tests for complete compilation
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths

Test Organization:
- By component (lexer, parser, semantic)
- By feature (language constructs)
- By error condition (error cases)
- By performance characteristic
```

### 2. Test Data Management

When organizing test cases:

```markdown
Test Categories:
- Positive tests (valid programs)
- Negative tests (error cases)
- Edge cases (boundary conditions)
- Performance tests (large inputs)

Management Strategies:
- Test case libraries
- Parameterized tests
- Generated test data
- Regression test suites
```

## Code Generation Decisions

### 1. Target Architecture Support

When adding support for new target architectures:

```markdown
Support Levels:
1. Basic code generation
2. Optimized code generation
3. Target-specific optimizations
4. Advanced features (SIMD, etc.)

Implementation Phases:
- Target description and configuration
- Instruction selection
- Register allocation
- Optimization passes
```

### 2. Optimization Strategy

When planning compiler optimizations:

```markdown
Optimization Categories:
- Local optimizations (basic blocks)
- Global optimizations (functions)
- Interprocedural optimizations
- Link-time optimizations

Implementation Order:
1. Essential optimizations (peephole, dead code)
2. Standard optimizations (constant folding, inlining)
3. Advanced optimizations (vectorization, loop optimizations)
4. Target-specific optimizations
```

## Documentation Decisions

### 1. API Documentation Scope

When planning API documentation:

```markdown
Documentation Levels:
- Public APIs (complete documentation)
- Internal APIs (developer documentation)
- Implementation details (code comments)

Content Requirements:
- Function signatures and parameters
- Usage examples
- Performance characteristics
- Error conditions
```

### 2. Language Specification Updates

When updating language specification:

```markdown
Update Categories:
- New language features
- Clarifications of existing behavior
- Error condition specifications
- Implementation notes

Validation Requirements:
- Specification consistency
- Implementation compliance
- Test case coverage
- Examples and tutorials
```
