# Type System Documentation

**This file has been merged into type_system.md**

The documentation for the Type system has been consolidated into [type_system.md](type_system.md) which contains both interface and implementation details for all Type system components.

## Key Components

- **Core Type System**: TypeId, TypeContext, and type categories
- **Type Resolver**: Converting type annotations to resolved TypeIds
- **Implementation Table**: Managing type implementations
- **Helper Functions**: Type operations and inspections

See [type_system.md](type_system.md) for the complete documentation.
