### **Finalized Semantic Analysis Plan**

#### **Overall Goal: Refinement and Transformation**

Our goal is to transform the syntactic **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** into a semantically validated, unambiguous **High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR)**. This will be achieved through a series of sequential passes that progressively enrich a single, mutable HIR data structure.

#### **Core Architecture: The Refinement Model**

We will employ a multi-pass "refinement" architecture. Instead of creating multiple distinct trees, we will perform one initial transformation from AST to a "skeletal" HIR, and then run a series of analysis passes that modify this single HIR tree in-place, filling in semantic information at each step.

#### **The High-Level IR (HIR)**

There will be a single, unified definition for the HIR (`hir.hpp`). This structure is designed to be refined.

*   **Structure:** The HIR's node types (`hir::Variable`, `hir::Call`, `hir::FieldAccess`) will represent the program's semantic structure, with syntactic sugar (like method call syntax) already desugared.
*   **Mutable Semantic Fields:** Fields that require analysis will be defined using `std::optional` (e.g., `std::optional<SymbolId> symbol`, `std::optional<TypeId> type_id`). This correctly models their state as "unfilled" at the beginning of the analysis pipeline.
*   **AST Back-Pointers:** Each HIR node will contain a non-owning pointer back to the original `ast::Node` it was created from. This is crucial for error reporting (providing line/column numbers) and for accessing original source names during analysis.

#### **Pass Invariants and Enforcement**

The correctness of our pipeline relies on **Pass Invariants**â€”guarantees that a pass makes about the state of the HIR upon its completion.

*   **Example Invariant:** After the `NameResolutionPass` completes, every `hir::Variable::symbol` field is guaranteed to be filled.
*   **Enforcement:** These invariants will be enforced in subsequent passes using `assert`. In debug builds, this will immediately catch logical errors in pass ordering. In release builds, these checks are compiled out for zero performance cost. To keep the code clean, we will use helper functions (e.g., `get_symbol(var)`, `get_type(expr)`) that wrap the assertion and value access.

### **The Semantic Analysis Pipeline (The Passes)**

The process is a strict, sequential pipeline. Each pass takes the HIR as input and modifies it for the next pass.

#### **Pass 0: Top-Level Scaffolding (on AST)**

*   **Action:** Before touching the HIR, two preliminary passes are run on the AST to build the global symbol table.
    1.  **Item Collection:** A quick traversal of the AST's top-level items (`fn`, `struct`, `impl`) to declare `UndefinedSymbol` placeholders in the global `Scope`.
    2.  **Definition Resolution:** A second traversal to resolve the signatures (function parameters/returns, struct fields, method signatures) of all items, transitioning the `Symbol`s from the `Undefined` to the `Defined` state.
*   **Output:** A complete, top-level symbol table ready for body analysis.

#### **Pass 1: Structural Transformation (AST -> Skeletal HIR)**

*   **Input:** The `ast::Program`.
*   **Action:** A mechanical, non-analytical traversal of the AST. For each `ast::Node`, a corresponding `hir::Node` is created.
    *   Syntactic sugar is desugared (e.g., `ast::MethodCallExpr` becomes a `hir::Call`).
    *   Original names are stored in the HIR nodes (e.g., `hir::Variable` stores the `ast::Identifier`).
    *   All `std::optional` semantic fields are left empty (`std::nullopt`).
*   **Output:** A `std::unique_ptr<hir::Program>` in its initial "skeletal" state.

#### **Pass 2: Name Resolution (Refines HIR)**

*   **Input:** The skeletal `hir::Program`.
*   **Action:** Traverses the HIR. For each node that contains a name (`hir::Variable`, etc.), it uses the `Scope` stack and the now-complete symbol table to find the corresponding `semantic::Symbol`. It then **modifies the HIR node in-place** by filling its `symbol` field.
*   **Output:** The same `hir::Program`, but now all names are resolved to unique `SymbolId`s.

#### **Pass 3: Type Checking & Inference (Refines HIR)**

*   **Input:** The name-resolved `hir::Program`.
*   **Action:** Traverses the HIR in a bottom-up fashion. It relies on the **Pass Invariant** that all symbols are resolved.
    *   For each expression, it uses the resolved symbols and the types of its children to infer or validate its own type.
    *   It **modifies the HIR node in-place** by filling its `type_id` field.
    *   It performs all type-related semantic checks (e.g., assignment compatibility, operator validity).
    *   It resolves other type-dependent entities (e.g., fills the `field` pointer in `hir::FieldAccess`).
*   **Output:** The final, fully enriched and validated `hir::Program`, ready for subsequent stages like borrow checking and code generation.
